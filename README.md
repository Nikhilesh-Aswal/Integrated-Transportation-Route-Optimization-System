Overview
This project models a network of cities connected by different modes of transportation (train, car, airplane). It provides functionality to find the shortest path and cost between cities based on the selected mode of transport. Additionally, it can determine the best possible travel option based on cost, irrespective of the transportation mode.
Features
City and Route Management: Add cities and define transportation routes with distance and cost details.
Multiple Transportation Modes: Supports train, car, and airplane travel.
Shortest Path Calculation: Uses Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path between cities for a selected mode of transportation.
Best Travel Option: Determines the most cost-effective travel option across all modes.

This C++ project simulates a network of cities connected by train, car, and airplane routes. It allows users to find the shortest path and cost between cities for specific transportation modes and determines the most economical travel option across all modes. Ideal for understanding city connectivity and optimizing travel decisions.
